自我介绍分析
-------

老师好，我是南昌大学软件工程专业 2017 级本科生阳家勋，很高兴与老师交流来介绍我自己。本科阶段，我担任班级体育委员，前五学期综合素质排名在本专业年级排名为 1/440(0.2%)，GPA 为 3.67/4.0；大学三年成绩年级排名均为前2%，连续两年以班级第一的身份获得南昌大学特等奖学金、国家励志奖学金；累计 26 门课程考核 90 以上；其中高等数学 96 分，C 语言程序设计 97 分；计算机编程类课程均分 92 分；英语水平良好，英语类课程均分 88 分，CET-6 级 481 分；确定能获得我校的推免资格。在本科阶段，我曾在江西省智慧城市重点实验室参与科研学习，对小目标检测方向做了一定的文献调研和实验验证；使用过 mmdetection 工具箱， follow 了一些单阶段、双阶段；anchor based、anchor free 模型。
1. 学习能力方面，我在编程类课程优势较为突出，编程类课程均分92分；在leetcode和poj中刷题超过500道，常写博客，程序设计与能力较好。

2. 我所取得的科研成果有：我以第二作者(导师第一)的身份在IEEE Systems Journal投稿一篇国际期刊《A novel WSNs based on energy welfare function》 ；结题国家级大学生创新创业训练项目《基于人工智能的弱听聋哑儿童言语康复训练平台》 ；申请国家专利《采用音节多维分析的聋哑儿童吐字发音质量评估方法》与软件著作权《弱听聋哑儿童言语康复训练系统》。
  本科期间，主要有两项科研项目经历，一项是 AnchorFitted：反馈驱动目标检测anchor仲裁者课题。此仲裁模型首先通过充分利用小目标与锚框的规模损耗作为反馈信息来指导是否对锚框进行修正，通过动态调整不恰当的锚框的大小，提供了更多优良的锚框；同时，IoU分组平衡采样策略使分类器将获得不同规模的均衡训练样本，提高了小物体的检测准确率。 
  另一项是《弱听聋哑儿童语音康复训练平台》项目，旨在帮助弱听聋哑儿童进行言语康复训练。该模型可计算得出被测词语与模仿词语的声母、韵母和声调的相似度评分及多维度累计记分。
  未来：我想从事机器学习、数据科学与计算机视觉方面的工作；能沉得下心与导师努力做科研， 希望能发表真正有价值的文章！
  性格：我在面对困难问题时，抗压和学习能力值得相信。
  展望：PKU 前沿交叉学科研究院是我最理想的深造地！希望在研究生期间，遇到一个更好的自己，能得到老师的指导，学到更多的东西，让我的研究生生涯因为我的努力争取而不产生遗憾！如果我能在硕士阶段的科研成果显著，我将继续深造投身学术界！
  非常感谢老师来听我的自我介绍。

  

  表格真的是用来做分栏对比的，要及时想出栏目的内容。

Hello, my name is Yang Jiaxun. I'm from Nanchang University, majoring in software engineering. I'm glad to talk with you and introduce myself. In the undergraduate stage, I served as a class sports committee member, ranking 1 / 440 (0.2%) in the first five semesters of my major in terms of comprehensive quality; ranking 2% in the first two years of my university in terms of academic performance, and I won the special scholarship and National Encouragement scholarship of Nanchang University as the first in my class for two consecutive years; my higher mathematics score was 96; my English level was good, and CET-6 got 481 scores. In the undergraduate stage, I participated in scientific research in Jiangxi smart city key laboratory, and did some experiments on small object detection; I used mmdetection toolbox, followed some single-stage and two-stage; anchor based and anchor free models.
1. In terms of learning ability, I have outstanding advantages in programming courses. The average score of computer programming courses is 92 points. I have good programming ability and often write blog.
2. In research achievements aspect: as the second author (tutor first), I contributed an international journal named 'a level WSNs based on energy welfare function' in IEEE Systems Journal; set up a national undergraduate innovation and entrepreneurship training project; applied for a national patent and software copyright.
I have two research projects, one is anchor fitted: feedback driven target detection anchor arbiter. In this arbitration model, the size loss of small target and anchor frame is used as feedback information to guide whether the anchor frame is modified. At the same time, IoU Group balanced sampling strategy enables the classifier to obtain balanced training samples of different scale.
The other is the speech rehabilitation training platform for deaf and mute children, which aims to help deaf and mute children carry out speech rehabilitation training. The model can calculate the similarity score and multi-dimensional cumulative score of the initials, finals and tones of the tested words and the imitated words.
In the future, I want to be engaged in machine learning, data science and computer vision.In character aspect, I love basketball and fitness.In terms of prospect, PKU is my ideal place for further study! I hope I can get the teacher's guidance during my graduate study, so as to and learn more knowledge.
Thank you very much for your introduction.

Dear teachers: Good morning, everyone. I'm Yang Jiaxun, from software engineering major of Nanchang University. First of all, thank you very much for listening to my self introduction.
Next, I will introduce myself from three aspects: personal introduction, learning ability, scientific research achievements and interests.
I ranked 3 / 404 (the top 0.8%) in my academic performance, and won the grand scholarship and national inspirational scholarship of Nanchang University as the first in my class for two consecutive years. I have participated in scientific research and learning in the direction of small target detection in Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of smart city.
1. First of all, in terms of learning ability, my university has been strict with myself for three years, learning from excellent teachers and classmates in class. I got more than 90 examinations in 26 courses. My English level is good, CET-6 481 points. In addition, I am more prominent in programming courses, programming courses average score of 92 points, programming and ability is good. In 2019, I arrived in Beijing to participate in Baidu youth al maker training camp and evaluate excellent campers. I have won the first prize of "Top 7" in China's "Ai" competition.
2. I not only focus on the study of professional knowledge, but also learn from Professor Xu Jianfeng and Professor Lin Deyu. My research achievements include: in 2020, as the second author (the first tutor), I contributed a new WSNs based on energy welfare function in the IEEE Systems Journal; in 2019, I set up a national innovation and entrepreneurship training project for college students, "speech rehabilitation training platform for hearing impaired children based on Artificial Intelligence", and applied for one national patent and one software copyright.
During my undergraduate period, I have two major research projects, one is anchor fitted: feedback driven target detection anchor arbiter project, which improves the detection accuracy of small targets.
The other is the project of speech rehabilitation training platform for deaf mute children with weak hearing, which aims to help them carry out speech rehabilitation training.
Hobbies, I usually like photography and playing basketball.
Prospect: School of data science and computer science of Sun Yat sen University is my ideal place for further study! I hope to meet a better self and learn more things during the postgraduate period, so that my graduate career will not produce regret because of my efforts!
Finally, thank you very much for my introduction.
