Dear professors: Good morning, nice to meet you. It is my pleasure to have this opportunity for introducing myself.
My name is Jiaxun Yang. I am from Nanchang University and majoring in software engineering.
Next, let me introduce myself from learning ability, research achievements, and hobbies.
First of all,undergraduate students must lay a solid foundation in academic knowledge.Through my diligent study, my academic grade ranked first in 404.And I have won 7 honors such as special scholarship and national inspirational scholarship. 
Secondly, I carried out some researchs on small object detection and followed some excellent one stage, two stage anchor-based and anchor-free model.In 2019, I set up a national project, a software copyright and a patent .I have won 7 national awards including AI and programming competitions.
In my spare time, I like playing basketball and photography, through which I can meet the challenge better.
Above all, Peking University is my ideal place for further study! Thank you very much for listening to my self introduction.I sincerely hope you can give me a chance to study in your school.

我来自南昌大学。它位于英雄城南昌市，建校于1921年。明年就是它的100年校庆。它具有优美的校园环境和良好的学习氛围。我的梦想就是通过勤奋的学习，将来有一天能进入中国的最高等学府：北京大学进行学习。

我的家乡是湖南城步，它是一个非常美丽的城市。每年夏天，都会有大量的游客来我们家乡游览。他们可以吃油茶，看南山大草原。我们家乡的景色往往让他们流年忘返。
My hometown is Chengbu, Hunan. It is a very beautiful city. Every summer, a large number of tourists come to visit my hometown. They can eat oil tea and see the Nanshan grassland. The scenery in my hometown often makes them forget to return.

我的科研经历是关于小目标检测。此仲裁模型首先通过充分利用小目标与锚框的规模损耗作为反馈信息来指导是否对锚框进行修正，基本解决了由不恰当的锚框导致目标与锚框的重叠度过小所以候选区域丢失的问题；同时，重叠度分组平衡采样策略使分类器将获得不同规模的均衡训练样本，提高了小物体的检测准确率。
My research experience is about small obeject detection. This model first uses the scale loss of small obejects as feedback information to guide whether to modify the anchor' size. And the IoU group balanced sampling strategy allows the classifier to obtain balanced training samples of different sizes, which improves the detection accuracy of small objects.
