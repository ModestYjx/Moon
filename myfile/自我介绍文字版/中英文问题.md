我的科研经历是关于小目标检测。此仲裁模型首先通过充分利用小目标与锚框的规模损耗作为反馈信息来指导是否对锚框进行修正，基本解决了由不恰当的锚框导致目标与锚框的重叠度过小所以候选区域丢失的问题；同时，重叠度分组平衡采样策略使分类器将获得不同规模的均衡训练样本，提高了小物体的检测准确率。
My research experience is about small obeject detection. This arbitration model first uses the scale loss of small obejects and anchor frames as feedback information to guide whether to modify the anchor frame, which basically solves the problem that the overlap of the target and the anchor frame is too small due to inappropriate anchor frames, so the candidate area is lost. At the same time, the overlapping degree group balanced sampling strategy allows the classifier to obtain balanced training samples of different sizes, which improves the detection accuracy of small objects.
